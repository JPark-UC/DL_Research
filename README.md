Codes in regards to the research "Supervised Domain Adaptation Applied to Heterogenous, Multi-Center MR Imaging Datasets".
This code shows how I have applied gradient reversal layer to a deep learning neural network to improve the generalization of these models.

The PDF is the paper that I have submitted for SIPAIM and will be available on their journel sometime next year.
